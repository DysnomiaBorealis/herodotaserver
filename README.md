This project is a local backend server built for my Android application, leveraging the Ktor framework, which is primarily built using Kotlin and Coroutines. The server is designed to handle various client requests, process query parameters, execute the necessary backend logic, and return fully prepared responses to the client (in this case, my Android app).

Throughout the project, I focused on ensuring smooth interaction between the client and the server by effectively managing client requests and responses.

I also integrated several key Kotlin technologies to enhance the serverâ€™s performance and maintainability:
1. Kotlin Coroutines: Used for efficient, non-blocking asynchronous programming to handle multiple client requests concurrently.
2. Dependency Injection with Koin: Implemented to manage dependencies cleanly and ensure scalability and testability in the project's architecture.
3. Custom Headers: Added custom headers to ensure the necessary security and proper communication between the server and the Android application.
4. Clean Architecture: Followed clean architecture principles to keep the code modular, flexible, and easier to maintain, ensuring separation of concerns between different layers of the application.

This server plays a crucial role in handling the backend logic for my Android application, ensuring that client requests are processed efficiently and data is managed securely.
